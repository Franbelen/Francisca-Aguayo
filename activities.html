    <p>As a student of mathematics, I have gained valuable skills in logical reasoning, problem-solving, and critical thinking. In addition to my mathematical expertise, I also have knowledge and experience in programming languages such as Python and currently learning C++. I have completed several programming projects, including a web-based data search interfase of a provied database and sofware proyects.</p>

<p>I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I am excited to see where my mathematical and programming skills will take me in the future.</p>
